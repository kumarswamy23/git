    <h1>A Little History of the World Wide Web</h1>
    <em><p>See also <a href="https://www.w3.org" target="_blank">How It All Started</a> presentation materials from the <a href="https://www.w3.org">W3C 10th Anniversary Celebration</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org">other references.</a><br>
    </p></em>
    from 1945 to 1995 <br>
    <h2>1945</h2>
    <p>Vannevar Bush writes <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com">an article</a> in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com">Atlantic Monthly</a> about a photo-electrical-mechanical device called a Memex, for memory extension, which could make and follow links between documents on microfiche
    </p>
    <h2>1960s</h2>
    <p>Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext browsing editing, email, and so on. He invents the mouse for this purpose. See the <a href="https://www.boosterap.org">Bootstrap Institute library.</a><br><br>
        Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in <em>A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate.</em> 20th National Conference, New York, <a href="https://www.acm.org">Association for Computing Machinery,</a> 1965. See also: Literary Machines. Note: There used to be a link here to "Hypertext and Hypermedia: A Selected Bibliography" by Terence Harpold, but the site hosting the resource did not maintain the link. <br><br>
        Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS in 1967.
        <h2>1980</h2>
        <p>While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a notebook program, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to be made between arbitrary nodes. Each node had a title, a type, and a list of bidirectional typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under SINTRAN-III. See: <a href="https://www.w3.org"> Enquire user manual as scanned images </a> or as <a href="https://www.w3.org">HTML page(alt).</a>

    <dd>Tim starts work on a hypertext GUI browser+editor using the NeXTStep development environment. He makes up "WorldWideWeb" as a name for the program. (See <a href="https://www.w3.org">the first browser</a> screenshot) "World Wide Web" as a name for the project (over Information Mesh, Mine of Information, and Information Mine).
        Project <a href="https://www.w3.org">original proposal</a> reformulated with encouragement from CN and ECP divisional management. Robert <a href="https://www.w3.org">Cailliau</a> (ECP) joins and is co-author of <a href="https://www.w3.org">new version.</a>

The first web server was nxoc01.cern.ch, later called info.cern.ch, and the <strong>first web page </strong>http://nxoc01.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html Unfortunately CERN no longer supports the historical site. Note from this era too, the <a href="https://www.w3.org"></a>we know of, last changed Tue, 13 Nov 1990 15:17:00 GMT (though the URI changed.)
